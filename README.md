📌 Project Overview
AtliQo, a leading telecom provider in India, launched 5G services in May 2022. Contrary to expectations, the company faced a decline in active users and revenue growth. This Tableau project analyzes key performance indicators (KPIs) from periods before and after the 5G launch to uncover trends and areas for optimization.

📊 Key Dashboards
Revenue Analysis: Regional revenue trends, before vs after 5G launch, and forecast insights.

Metric Analysis: Trends in ARPU, TAU, active/inactive users, and unsubscribe patterns.

City Analysis: City-level performance and market share comparisons.

Plan Analysis: Revenue breakdown by recharge plans and timeframes.

🧠 Insights & Conclusion
Revenue vs Active Users: Post-5G, plan revenue increased but active users declined.

Retention Focus: Modified offers in underperforming cities can improve user engagement.

Market Share Dynamics: AtliQo’s share dropped—strategy revision is key.
